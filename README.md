# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
Problem statement: In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry generally experiences high annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business
goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, we will analyze customer-level data of a telecom firm, and will generate insights on the influential factors leading to the churn of the customers. The dataset used in this project is from IBM Sample Data Sets, which is hosted on Kaggle. For more information, please refers to the Kaggle dataset description.
